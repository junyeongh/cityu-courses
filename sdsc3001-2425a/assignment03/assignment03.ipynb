To compute $minSub(A)$, you can refer to the file \"patterns_Apriori.txt\" containing all the frequent patterns of support at least $21$. Each line of \"patterns_Apriori.txt\" is in the form $id_1,id_2,...,id_l:sup$, where $id_1,id_2,...,id_l$ denotes a pattern $\\{id_1,id_2,...,id_l\\}$ and $sup$ is the support of this pattern.

If your algorithm returns some pattern that is not in the \"patterns_Apriori.txt\" file, probably your algorithm is not implemented correctly.)"
