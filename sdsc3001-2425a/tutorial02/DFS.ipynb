    "# Topic: DFS, Depth-first search\n",
    "> Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the **root node** (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and **explores as far as possible along each branch** before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to **keep track** of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.\n",
