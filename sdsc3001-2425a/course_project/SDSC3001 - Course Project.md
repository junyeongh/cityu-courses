# SDSC3001 - Course Project

## Instruction

In the project, you and your teammates (at most 5 students per team) need to reproduce a paper about big data techniques. To reproduce a paper, you need to read it and understand its core techniques. If you have trouble understanding the theoretical parts, that is okay. However, you should at least be able to implement the algorithms proposed in the paper. Then you can try to apply your implementation on the datasets used in the paper as well as other datasets available online to test the performance of the proposed algorithms. Finally, you need to write a report that includes

- (1) The research problem that the paper wants to address.
- (2) The challenges of the research problem.
- (3) A brief introduction of the solution proposed by the paper.
- (4) The experiments you conduct to test the performance of the proposed algorithms.
- (5) Your thoughts about how to improve the proposed algorithms. (Optional)

To find an appropriate paper, you may want to browse recent papers published in major big data conferences such as SIGMOD (<https://sigmod.org/>), VLDB (<https://www.vldb.org/>), KDD (<https://www.kdd.org/>), ICDE (<https://icde2021.gr/>), etc.  Below is a list of recommended papers that you can choose. Note that it is totally okay if you choose a paper that is not on the list.
